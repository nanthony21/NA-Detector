This UI streams images from a Thorlabs CCD camera connected to a microscope with a Bertrand lens in order to provide detailed microscope aperture alignment.
Aperture diameter can be automatically measured using a variety of methods. By measuring a reference NA (Objective collection numerical aperture), a target NA can be set. The UI will
then guide the user towards aligning the aperture with the target NA.
